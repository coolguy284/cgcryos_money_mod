move oprequirement onto zop subcategory as a whole
make command objects static
add way to set default account to none
make transfer commands send chat message to receiving player, zop to sending player as well (maybe as a config option defaulting to true)
add command that lists total money of each player and total on server as a whole

potential:
better wording for negative numbers in commands
